REACT:
React is a libarary used to build front end
React is a SPA(single page application) application
React is a component based architecture

adv:
1. Easy to build  applications  when compared to angular/other frameworks
2. VDOM->virtual DOM(donot loads the entire page only loads the changes made to the page)

why vite?
    1.gives more dependencies
    2.does not have report hurdles folder(that causes the project not to work on updation)
    3.does not have a build folder that can be easily replicated ,easy to crack the original folders
    4.if react is replaced with angular it can be changed to angular project

folder structure
1.node_modules(installs all the dependencies to the repo in this folder) 
2.public
      |
      ->vite.svg
3.src
    |
    ->assets
           |
           ->react.svg
    |
    ->app.css(styling)
    |
    ->app.jsx(component)
    |
    ->index.css(styling)
    |
    ->main.css(component)
4.gitignore (ignores these files while pushing)
5.index.html(starting point of the project)
6.package.json(inportant file denotes it is a node project)
7.package.lock.json(locks the dependencies)
8.vite.config.js


components:
    1.class(not in use)
    2.functional
       eg:
       function home(){
        return (
            <div>
            <h1>welcome to react</h1>
            <h2>fc</h2>
            </div>
        )
       }
       export default home;  (only then it can be recognized)
